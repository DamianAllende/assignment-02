			<h2><span class="subrayado">Mark Bolton Design</span> & <span class="monotype">Monotype</span></h2>

			<h1>Hello.</h1>
			<p>Mark Boulton Design was a small desing. In 2014, <span><a href="#"> we were acquired by Monotype</a></span>.
			<br>
			Over the years, we <span><a href="#">bulit an amazing team</a></span> and worked on some <span><a href="#">tremendous projects wiht the smartest clients</a></span>. That's something we're proud of, and thankful for. But, it's time for a change
			<br>
			The move to Monotype brings us closer to the problems we want to fix. Mark Boulton Desing is now closed. The team will be working on Monotyope proyects from the same premises in the UK and we'll still be writing, still blogging, and still speaking at web coferences. We're not going anywhere.
